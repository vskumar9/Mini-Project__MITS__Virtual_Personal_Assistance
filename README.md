ABSTRACT


In this modern era, day to day life became smarter and interlinked with technology. We already know some voice assistance like google, Siri. etc. Now in our voice assistance system, it can act as a basic medical prescriber, daily schedule reminder, note writer, calculator and a search tool. This project works on voice input and give output through voice and displays the text on the screen. The main agenda of our voice assistance makes people smart and give instant and computed results. Natural Language Processing algorithm helps computer machines to engage in communication using natural human language in many forms


INTRODUCTION


Today the development of artificial intelligence (AI) systems that can organize a natural human-machine interaction (through voice, communication, gestures, facial expressions, etc.) are gaining in popularity. One of the most studied and popular was the direction of interaction, based on the understanding of the machine by the machine of the natural human language. It is no longer a human who learns to communicate with a machine, but a machine learns to communicate with a human, exploring his actions, habits, behaviour and trying to become his personalized assistant

❖ To design a device that acts as a digital organizer to provide variety of services to its master. It will look at examples of intelligent programs with natural language processing that are currently available, with different categories of support, and examine the potential usefulness of one specific piece of software as a VPA. 
❖ It continues to expand its digital abilities in organizing events, ordering food, playing music, guiding services for travelling, game prediction etc. It is suggested that new technologies may soon make the idea of virtual personal assistants a reality. Experiments conducted on this system, combined with user testing, have provided evidence that a basic program with machine learning algorithms in the form of a digital personal assistant. 
❖ Using machine learning algorithms to iteratively learn user’s preference for each theme based on quality feedback given by the user. The concept of a virtual assistant which is a digital service looking after a range of our needs is fast becoming a reality.
❖ As artificial intelligence and machine learning progress at pace, digital assistants are set to become our gateway to the internet and know more about us than we do ourselves. Siri and Google now are just the beginning. The device accepts voice input processes it through various machine learning algorithms to provide desired output to user


The following are some of the libraries present in the virtual personal assistant
•	SPEECH RECOGNITION
•	PYWHATKIT
•	GOOGLETRANS
•	PYAUDIO
•	GTTS
•	SMTPLIB
•	WOLFRAMALPHA
•	PYJOKES
•	WIKIPEDIA
•	WEB BROWSER

1.1	Speech Recognition:
SpeechRecognition is a Python library that provides support for recognizing speech in audio files or live microphone input. It supports a variety of speech recognition engines including Google Cloud Speech API, IBM Speech to Text, and CMU Sphinx, among others. The library can be used to transcribe spoken words into text, identify spoken words and phrases, and perform speaker diarylation.

1.2	PywhatKit:
Pywhatkit is a Python library that provides functionality to schedule and automate tasks such as sending messages and making calls at specific times. It is often used for scheduling reminders, automating online activities, and performing other time-based tasks.

1.3	webbrowser:
The webbrowser module in Python is a built-in library that provides an interface to interact with web browsers. This module allows developers to open URLs in a web browser, either in a new tab or window, or to open a web browser in a new process. The webbrowser module also provides methods for searching for and launching web browsers.

1.4	Googletrans:
Google Trans is a Python library that provides an interface to the Google Translate API. The Google Translate API is a cloud-based machine translation service that can translate text from one language to another. The Google Translate API provides support for a wide range of languages and is used by many companies and organizations to provide translation services for their websites and applications.

1.5	Pyaudio:
PyAudio is a Python library that provides support for recording and playing audio in Python. It provides a simple and easy-to-use interface for working with audio streams, including functions for recording audio from a microphone or playing audio from a file.

1.6	Gtts:
gTTS (Google Text-to-Speech), is a Python library that allows you to convert text to speech using Google's Text-to-Speech API. The API provides high-quality, natural-sounding speech synthesis and can be used to generate speech for a wide range of applications, including accessibility tools, educational software, and entertainment applications.

1.7	SMTPlib:
SMTP is a Python library that provides support for sending email messages through Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP). SMTP is a protocol for sending email messages between servers, and it is used by most email providers to send messages over the internet.

1.8	WolframAlpha:
Wolfram Alpha is a computational knowledge engine, created by Stephen Wolfram, that provides answers to a wide range of questions and problems across various domains, including mathematics, science, engineering, history, geography, economics, and many others.

1.9	Pyjokes:
Pyjokes is a Python library that provides a simple way to generate jokes. The library has a collection of jokes stored in its database and can randomly select a joke and return it to the user.

1.10	wikipedia:
Wikipedia is a Python library that provides an easy way to access and retrieve information from Wikipedia. The library uses the Wikipedia API to access information from the online encyclopedia, allowing developers to easily retrieve articles, sections, links, categories, translations, etc.

1.11	Web Browser:
The webbrowser module in Python is a built-in library that provides an interface to interact with web browsers. This module allows developers to open URLs in a web browser, either in a new tab or window, or to open a web browser in a new process. The webbrowser module also provides methods for searching for and launching web browsers.

1.12	Pyjokes:
Pyjokes is a Python library that provides a simple way to generate jokes. The library has a collection of jokes stored in its database and can randomly select a joke and return it to the user.

1.13	UTILS:
Python Utils is a collection of small Python functions and classes which make common patterns shorter and easier. It is by no means a complete collection but it has served me quite a bit in the past and I will keep extending it. One of the libraries using Python Utils is Django Utils.
